Embed SVG into QGS/QML
==========================

The tool adds SVG markers to QGS project file or QML style file. 

QGIS enterface allows to embed SVG markers to style, but only one-by-one. If a style has a big variety of markers, this takes a lot of time and concentration to avoid mistakes. The tool embeds all SVG markers of the layer style, or of the entire QGIS project.

Input: ZIP-archive with 

* SVG files;
* QGS project file / QML style file, into which SVG vector markers will be embedded.

Output:

* ZIP-archive with updated QGS project file / QML style file (depending on the input).
