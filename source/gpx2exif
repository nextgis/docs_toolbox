Add coordinates to images using track 
=====================================

Use timing information to assign coordinates to photos matching them with a GPX track. Coordinates are added to EXIF tags. If your camera doesn't store coordinates or does so incorrectly, you can match photos made while recording a track by using timestamps.

Input:

* GPX file
* ZIP with photos

The tool can process photos with or without EXIF tags. Existing tags will be replaced with new ones.

Output:

* ZIP with photos that have new EXIF tags
